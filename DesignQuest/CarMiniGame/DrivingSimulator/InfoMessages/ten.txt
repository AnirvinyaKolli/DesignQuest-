Failing to use turn signals properly is a factor in 2 million accidents annually in the U.S. alone. Many drivers either forget or intentionally neglect to signal when changing lanes or turning, leading to confusion and preventable collisions. Signaling three seconds before making a turn gives other drivers time to react and improves overall road safety.
