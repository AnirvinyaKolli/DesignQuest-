Underinflated tires reduce traction, increase braking distances, and make blowouts more likely, especially at high speeds. Studies show that properly inflated tires can improve fuel efficiency by up to 3% and reduce the risk of accidents caused by tire failure. Worn-out treads also reduce grip, particularly on wet roads, where hydroplaning becomes a serious hazard. Checking tire pressure and tread depth regularly can prevent dangerous situations and improve overall vehicle safety.
